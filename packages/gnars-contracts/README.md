# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
pnpm hardhat help
pnpm hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true pnpm hardhat test
pnpm hardhat node
pnpm hardhat run scripts/proposeAuctionHouseUpgrade.ts

Here’s a draft script for our broadcast tomorrow. Feel free to make any changes you want!
